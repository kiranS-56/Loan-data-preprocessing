# Loan-data-preprocessing
You are working as a data analyst in the data science team of a central bank in Europe.
Your team has been assigned to create a credit risk model which estimates the probability of default for every personal account.

Goal : To obtain a clean and preprocessed loan data set.

Duty assigned : 
1.	The loan data we've been given is a sample from a larger data set that belongs to an affiliate bank based in the United States. Therefore, all the values are in dollars, so we need to provide their euro equivalents.
2.	Every categorical variable must be quantified. So we need to change any text columns into numbers based on the information they contain.
3.	Note down changes made to the original data set

The loan information is stored in the CSV file called loan data,

Caution : Be extremely risk averse and distrustful of any unavailable data. Missing information suggests foul play because loan applications are self reported 

Once the data is ready to be analyzed, we'll save it to an external CSV file and pass it on to the data scientists on the team. In turn, they will use it to construct a credit risk model that measures probability of default.
